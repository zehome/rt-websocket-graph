For many years i wanted to create a system which would permits to view system machine statistics "real time". (Like io statistics on a production server).

Todays technologies like google chrome / html5 / websocket now permits to do so easyly.

This is my experiment in that way.


You'll need nodejs with npm: connect, socket.io-connect to run it.
